## Welcome

I will try to put down my thought process on how to solve a problem using specific data structure/algorithm.
I will be trying to explain it step by step so that it can be used as a reference for me or others who are in same state as me.

### Data Structure

 Data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Algorithms

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sundarms/dsa/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
